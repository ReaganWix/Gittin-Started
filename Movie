**My Favorite Movie**
My favorite movie is Pride and Prejudice.
_Why? You might ask..._
Well, my family has a tradition of watching certain movies together at certain times. For example, on Thanksgiving day we always end up watching The Lord of the Rings... Do we finish them all? No. But thats not whats  important. Pride and Prejudice is also one of those movies that we watch all the time. Although we don't have a secific holiday where we watch it. It kind of just happens. I have probably seen that movie hundreds of times and I can quote most of it.
