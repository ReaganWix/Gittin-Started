**My Favorite Movie**


My favorite movie is Pride and Prejudice. Not the TV series and not the zombie one. The 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen.


_Why? You might ask..._


Well, my family has a tradition of watching certain movies together at certain times. For example, on Thanksgiving day we always end up watching The Lord of the Rings... Do we finish them all? No. But thats not whats  important. Pride and Prejudice is also one of those movies that we watch all the time. Although we don't have a secific holiday where we watch it. It kind of just happens. I have probably seen that movie hundreds of times and I can quote most of it.

Some of my favorite quotes include:

_"What A Superbly Featured Room And What Excellent Boiled Potatoes! Many Years Since I've Had Such An Exemplary Vegetable." -Mr. Collins_

_"You have bewitched me body and soul. And I love...I love...I love you. I never wish to be parted from you from this day on." -Mr. Darcy_

_"So what do you recommend, to encourage affection?"_ ... _"Dancing. Even If One's Partner Is Barely Tolerable." -Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth_
